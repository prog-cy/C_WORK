This is old content.
And it will remains same.
when I am modifying the file. 

And now I am adding new content
in the file,
and it is good practice.
for file handling.

And again I am adding new 
content in the file
it will also print in the 
file.

I am third time writing in the file.

I am adding new content
in the file fourth time.
and it is good for me
that i could do this.

I used fseek() and SEEK_END
to do this task
